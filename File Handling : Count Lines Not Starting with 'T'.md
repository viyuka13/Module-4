# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
      def returnSum(myDict):
          final=0
          for i in myDict.values():
              final+=i
          return final
      #driver functions
      
      myDict = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}
      print("Sum :",returnSum(myDict))

## Result
The Python program to count lines not starting with 'T' in story.txt has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
